<p>Today was the big day of WWDC 2019, and after the excitement of waiting for the keynote, here are my immediate thoughts and reactions to the announcements:</p>

<ol>
<li>Declarative UI in Swift seems like a massive step forward for iOS development. I first started iOS development back in iOS 5 at a time when the platform and developer tools for iOS were just vastly more elegant and efficient compared to Android. Since then Android / Google has stepped up its game, with a better IDE (Android Studio), a better language (Kotlin), and recently a declarative UI framework (<a href="https://flutter.dev">Flutter</a>). SwiftUI seems like a natural evolution in the competition of UI frameworks, and I&#39;m super excited to see it. Here are some of my deeper thoughts and questions I look forward to exploring:

<ul>
<li>How far does SwiftUI embrace pure functional programming? How is state managed?</li>
<li>I&#39;m curious how functional reactive programming fits into SwiftUI.</li>
<li>Converting an app incrementally to use SwiftUI seems like a really important feature practically. But in this context one might have much more stateful non-SwiftUI code having to interact with SwiftUI code. How messy will it be to deal with this?</li>
<li>The live editing and reloading looks super super awesome. However, I&#39;m a bit skeptical about the drag-and-drop editing of UI which actually edits your code. I think if it works well it could be awesome, but I&#39;m worried about the failure that is editing XML layouts in Android. I just need to wait until I actually try it.</li>
<li>By writing your UI declaratively, Apple is able to give you a bunch of UI features in your app <strong>for free</strong>. It will take some time to be aware of which features you do or don&#39;t get for free, but I think this is a huge plus, both for developers and for Apple. Personally I consider 3D touch to be a bit failure, with one of the factors being slow adoption by developers. Imagine if instead, Apple could have launched 3D touch with automatic support for it in a majority of apps. There is a lot of subtlety and issues here (what if Apple turns on a feature you don&#39;t want?), but this is a really interesting feature since it could pay large dividends in the future.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Improving privacy in APIs: I&#39;m a bit surprised that it took Apple so long to realize that they location tracking settings of iOS are too coarse-grained. Regardless, I&#39;m happy as a user to only let apps use my location once. As a developer, I expect / hope that Apple has made the API for this require nearly no additional code. The &quot;Sign in with Apple&quot; feature also seems pretty great and well thought out.</li>
<li>Every year Apple shows with gushing emotion and baby pictures a new UI for the photos app. We&#39;ll see if this one sticks around.</li>
<li>The multiwindow support for apps in iPadOS seems like a long time coming. I&#39;m curious what the possibility of IPC is between app windows.</li>
<li>AR stuff seems cool and fun, but I&#39;m always left wondering why I should care. The motion capture and people occlusion seem like they could open up AR to be useful in other new domains which I might care more about then games. I was a bit disappointed that Apple didn&#39;t have more compeling demo of these features (as awesome as Minecraft is).</li>
</ol>

<p>Anyways, WWDC is super exciting this year, and I&#39;m pretty hyped to give some of these new features and APIs a try. I&#39;ll update this as I watch more videos from the conference!</p>
