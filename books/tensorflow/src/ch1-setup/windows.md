# Windows Setup

To be blunt, I only use macOS and Linux, and I have no experience installing TensorFlow or even Python on Windows. Instead, I will simply direct you to the [official documentation for TensorFlow on Windows](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_windows).

When installing Python, please ensure that you use Python 3, rather than Python 2. Also, install the Python packages [NumPy](https://www.numpy.org), [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org) in addition to TensorFlow.

## Optional: Installing an IDE

At this point, everything we need for writing TensorFlow code in installed. We can write our Python code in a text editor of our choice, and run it using `python` from terminal. In the future I won't assume use of an IDE specifically, but rather assume that you can create new Python files and run them, either from terminal or an IDE. However, some people may prefer using an IDE, which can reduce the time spent in terminal, and help provide better syntax and semantic checking of Python code. Personally, I use and recommend PyCharm, which you can download for free [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows). I won't provide specific installation instructions, but I found it very easy to install and configure.
